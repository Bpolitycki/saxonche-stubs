# saxonche-stubs

Type stubs for the [saxonche](https://pypi.org/project/saxonche/) python package. This package has no functionality itself, but is merely an addition to the completion within IDEs. The basis for type annotations and comments is the documentation of [the Saxon Python API](https://www.saxonica.com/saxon-c/doc11/html/saxonc.html).

At the moment not all APIs are fully typed.
